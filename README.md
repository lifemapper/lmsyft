# Welcome to the Specify Network Broker and Analyst services!

The Specify Network consists of tools and services to serve the Specify Collections
Consortium.  There are currently several elements in production, and some still in
development.

This work has been supported by NSF Awards NSF BIO-1458422, OCI-1234983.

## Specify Network Broker
The Specify Broker searches for information related to an occurrence object
information from other data services, such as GBIF, iDigBio, OpenTreeOfLife, ITIS,
WoRMS, and more.  It presents the related digital object elements in a frontend,
primarily accessed through the Specify application.

The Specify Broker houses objects and common tools used within a Broker installation
that may also be useful for outside contributors and the community as a whole.

## Specify Network Analyst (in development)

The Specify Network Analyst is in development, and will be a set of specimen-based
analytics assessing the composition of collection holdings and available species
information.

Individual collections will be compared with data downloaded regularly from GBIF:
https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/download?basis_of_record=PRESERVED_SPECIMEN&basis_of_record=FOSSIL_SPECIMEN&basis_of_record=OCCURRENCE&advanced=1&occurrence_status=present

These data are used to compare and assess collections against and among the collective
holdings globally distributed data.  The analytics are then returned to the
contributing institutions and others to assist those collections in prioritizing
collecting and digitization efforts, institutional loans, mergers, deaccessions, and
more, to improve, the overall quality of the collection.  This information can also be
used by the community as a whole to identify gaps in species knowlege or redundancies.

The Analyst presents this information in multivariate-, but subsettable, space
to provide as much value and feedback to the community as possible.
