Welcome to the Syftorium!

The Syftorium is a collection of specimen-based analytics assessing the composition of
collection holdings and available species information. These data are used to compare
and assess collections against and among the collective holdings of all of the world's
data that we can get our hands on.  This information is then made available back to the
institutions and others so that it can assist those collections in prioritizing
collecting and digitization efforts, institutional loans, mergers, deaccessions, et
cetera in order to improve, or show off, the overall quality of the collection.  This
information can also be used by the community as a whole to identify gaps in species
knowlege and redundancies for similar motivations.  The Syftorium presents this
information in multivariate-, but subsettable, space in order to create the most
compelling picture of the data as possible in order to provide as much value and
feedback to the community as we can.
