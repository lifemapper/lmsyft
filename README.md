# t-rex
The Lifemapper t-rex repository houses objects and common tools used within a
Lifemapper Broker and Resolver installation that may also be useful for outside 
contributors and the community as a whole.

Any community contributed tool through the
[T-Rex Python Repository](https://github.com/lifemapper/t-rex/) should
use these objects to ensure that new contributions are compatible with the
Lifemapper backend.
