"""Local configuration values for lmtrex

Note:
    The RPM build creates local_constants.py with roll-specific values from the 
    local_constants.py.in template. The script update-apache-config (from the 
    lifemapper-lab roll's rocks-lmlab rpm) fills in the fully-qualified-domain-name 
    after install.
